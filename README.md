# Miedz-Jam

Code from my game made on "Mied≈∫ jam" on 17-23.05.2021.
This is a city builder-like game as the player needs to take care of buildings and need to take care of stats like: 
- citizens amount, 
- the energy required by the city infrastructure,
- cooper level,
- money
That was my first contact with Scriptable Objects.
